## üöÄ Devpost Submission Steps

### 1. Verify Deployed API

Check that your API Gateway endpoint is still active:

```bash
# Test the deployed endpoint
curl -X POST https://u77rgya1pd.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "median 1-bed rent in Toronto"}'
```

If the endpoint is down or changed, update `index.html` line 85:
```javascript
const API = "https://YOUR_NEW_API_URL/prod/agent";
```

### 2. Record Demo Video (3 minutes max)

**Recommended structure** (use Loom, OBS, or QuickTime):

#### Minute 0:00-0:30 - Introduction
- "Hi, I'm [name], and this is RentPilot - an AI agent that helps renters find affordable housing in Canadian cities"
- "It uses AWS Bedrock Claude 3 Sonnet for transparent planning and verification"

#### Minute 0:30-1:30 - Live Demo (UI)
1. Open `index.html` in browser
2. Click **"Quick check"** sample button
   - Show: Plan, Verify OK, Answer summary
3. Click **"Shortlist areas"** sample button
   - Show: Top 3 recommendations with transit scores
4. Toggle **"Show JSON envelope"**
   - Point out: strict schema, verify field, recommendations array

#### Minute 1:30-2:15 - Architecture Walkthrough
1. Open `ARCHITECTURE.md` in editor
2. Scroll to Mermaid diagram
3. Explain flow: "User query ‚Üí Planning (Bedrock) ‚Üí Execute Tools ‚Üí Finalize (Bedrock) ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Ledger"
4. Highlight: "Bedrock is called TWICE - once for planning, once for summarizing"

#### Minute 2:15-2:45 - Code Transparency
1. Open `agent_bedrock.py` in editor
2. Show `_local_verify` function (line 188-246)
   - "If no recommendations, we provide actionable hints like 'try increasing max distance'"
3. Show ledger write (line 467-479)
   - "Every interaction is logged to JSONL for reproducibility"

#### Minute 2:45-3:00 - Wrap-up
- "RentPilot demonstrates transparent AI: you see the plan, the tools called, the verification, and the data sources"
- "Thanks for watching! Code and deployment instructions are in the README"

**Upload video to**:
- YouTube (unlisted or public)
- Loom
- Vimeo

Copy the URL for Devpost submission form.

### 3. Upload to Devpost

Go to: https://awsaiagentglobalhackathon.devpost.com/

#### Required Fields:

**Project Name**: RentPilot: Transparent Affordability Agent

**Tagline** (80 chars max):
```
AWS Bedrock agent helping renters find affordable housing with transparent reasoning
```

**Description** (copy from README.md introduction):
```
A transparent AI agent built for the AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon that helps renters
find affordable housing in Canadian cities. RentPilot uses Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet)
to orchestrate a deterministic pipeline: plan ‚Üí act ‚Üí verify ‚Üí summarize, returning a
strict machine-readable JSON envelope alongside a friendly human summary.

Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Transparent Planning: See what the agent decided to do before it acts
‚Ä¢ Deterministic Tools: Rent data, neighbourhood stats, affordability calculations
‚Ä¢ Local Verification: Actionable hints when filters are too strict
‚Ä¢ Audit Trail: Every interaction logged to JSONL ledger
‚Ä¢ Strict JSON Envelope: {plan, actions, verify, answer, meta}

Tech Stack:
‚Ä¢ Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet) via Converse API
‚Ä¢ AWS Lambda (7 serverless functions)
‚Ä¢ API Gateway (REST API)
‚Ä¢ Python 3.11
‚Ä¢ SAM (Infrastructure as Code)
```

**Demo URL**:
```
https://u77rgya1pd.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/agent
```
(Or your S3-hosted UI URL if you deployed demo_viewer.html)

**Video URL**:
```
[Paste your YouTube/Loom/Vimeo URL here]
```

**Repository URL**:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rentpilot
```
(Make sure the repo is public!)

**Built With** (select tags):

## üìã Final Verification Checklist

Before clicking Submit on Devpost:

- [ ] ZIP file created and is 50-70 KB (not too large = no venv/build artifacts)
- [ ] AGENTCORE_NOTES.md is NOT in the ZIP (unzip -l to verify)
- [ ] Demo video uploaded and URL copied
- [ ] GitHub repo is public
- [ ] README.md in repo matches what's in ZIP
- [ ] API Gateway endpoint is still live (test with curl)
- [ ] index.html has correct API URL (if submitting UI demo)
- [ ] No placeholder text in any .md files (check COMPLIANCE.md)

## üéì Judging Criteria Alignment

Your submission addresses all criteria:

| Criterion | Evidence in Submission |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Potential Impact** | Solves real affordability crisis; CMHC data cited; reproducible |
| **Creativity** | Transparent verify step with hints; lenient JSON parsing; strict envelope |
| **Technical Execution** | SAM build passes; IAM scoped correctly; ledger; no crashes |
| **Functionality** | Working API + UI; 4 sample prompts; graceful error handling |
| **Presentation** | README + ARCHITECTURE + COMPLIANCE docs; demo video; code comments |

## üèÜ Prize Categories You're Eligible For

Based on your implementation:

‚úÖ **Best Amazon Bedrock Application**
- Uses Bedrock Converse API for planning + finalization
- Evidence: `agent_bedrock.py:295-410`, `template.yaml:80-121`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Best Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Implementation**
- NOT eligible (no AgentCore primitives like Knowledge Base, Action Groups, or Guardrails)
- Could add Knowledge Base for FAQ retrieval (see AGENTCORE_NOTES.md - but you excluded this, which is correct)

‚úÖ **Most Innovative Use of AI Agents**
- Transparent verify step with actionable hints
- Dual Bedrock calls (planning vs finalization)
- Ledger for reproducibility
